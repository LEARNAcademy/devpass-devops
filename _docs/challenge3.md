## Broken Nginx Configs 

### The server is down!! Go through each of the 5 servers you have been assigned and figure out what is wrong with each. The server ips will come to each of you via slack. 

You will need the key found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/sharedkey.pem) to access the servers. Refer to the instructions from [day 1]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/challenge1) on how to set the key permissions correctly and ssh in to the boxes

> Leave this key called "sharedkey_rsa" 
> DO NOT over write your ~/.ssh/devpass_rsa key from day 1
